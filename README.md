## EternalBloom- Empowering your cycle, every step of the way 

In the current world where women's health needs to take a center stage, our mobile application is here to change how women approach hygiene and well-being. With a focus on simplicity and practicality, our platform offers tools to track menstrual cycles, gain personalized health insights, access educational content, and connect with healthcare professionals. 
Beyond just tracking periods, our app aims to empower women by providing them with the information and support they need to prioritize their health. Whether it's receiving reminders for hygiene practices or finding nearby shops for sanitary products, we're committed to making every aspect of women's hygiene accessible and convenient.
But our mission goes beyond convenience â€“ we're dedicated to breaking down stigmas surrounding menstruation and promoting a culture of openness and empowerment. By fostering a supportive community and promoting health awareness, we're helping women everywhere take control of their well-being.
